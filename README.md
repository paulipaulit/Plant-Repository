## About project
Plant Repository is a simple program, which allows in simple way to know the basic parameters of selected plants.
The user chooses what he wants to do by entering number. The program executes the code snippet as selected by the user. Communication with the user is written in English.
The Plant Repository project was originally created as a course material for one of the subjects in IT studies. Currently, I use code to develop my Python programming skills.

## How to use program

### Technical parameters
The program does not have excessive hardware requirements. The recommended operating system is Windows 11

- Recommended Python version: 3.8.10
- Recommended program: PyCharm 2021.3.3
- Libraries: 
    - xml.etree.ElementTree, 
    - xml.dom.minidom, 
    - bs4 (class BeautifulSoup)

### Working with program
Currently, the program displays text on the console, therefore installation of any additional programs is not required (apart from the interpreters recommended above).

##### Additional informations
The program is used to operate the plant database (reading and editing the database). The database, due to the small amount of data, can be found in the xml file.

##### Functionalities
The user chooses what he wants to do. Currently, there are options:
* Listing plants from the repository
* Displaying a specific plant from the repository based on its name
* Adding a plant to the repository

## Project expantion plan
This program is under construction. Below I present ideas on how I want to develop my project. If you have any other suggestions, please feel free to contact me :)

1. New functionality: The ability to remove plants from the base
2. New functionality: Possibility to search plants by their parameters
3. Graphic design - operating the program from the window level (not from the console)
4. Restricting users' rights (reading the database separately, editing the database separately)

### Thank you very much for your interest in my program!
